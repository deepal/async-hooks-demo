# Async Hooks Examples

This repository contains async hooks examples used in my blog article at https://blog.insiderattack.net.

Async hooks set up and the logger can be found in the `setup` directory.

### How to run examples

1. Clone the repository and open the repository directory in terminal
2. To run an example file, simply use `node <file.js>` command

All async hooks logs are written to a file called `log` in the same directory.
